                  I&apos;m a software developer, hobby collector, and infrequent speaker from Jacksonville, FL üçä. I&apos;m a millennial who has been building websites since 2004 and writing code professionally since 2013.
                  I&apos;m usually writing Ruby (on Rails), JavaScript, and HTML & CSS. My day job is typically spent in the backend of the codebase. However, I&apos;ve been exploring the frontend during my free time and have been loving it.
                  I write <Link href="/blog">blog posts</Link>, <Link href="/twitter">post tweets</Link>, and have some cool stuff in the works for the future.

                  <strong>I wrote my first line of HTML on Microsoft Notepad in 2004 and fell head-over-heels for how magical it all felt</strong>. The problem I was solving in 2004? My Neopets shop page wasn&apos;t pretty enough. I was 12 years old.

                  I spent a couple days working up the courage to convince my parents to put their credit card information into a form on a website and buy me a domain. They did. And my first website was born. I learned everything, HTML/CSS, creating graphics in Paint Shop Pro and Animation Shop, and getting my website live, by reading posts written by kids my age. Soon I started writing my own posts sharing my knowledge, my pitfalls, my cool experiments.

                  <strong>I didn&apos;t jump straight into the tech industry</strong>. As school got more demanding and with the freedom that having my driver&apos;s license allowed me, I stopped updating my sites. I still always came back to it in some capacity. Running a MySpace layout page, creating a message board for a band I liked, running an eCommerce site with my friends to sell shirts we designed. I didn&apos;t know at the time that what I was doing could be a career. I entered into college to be an elementary school teacher but dropped out after failing a course titled College Success (twice). I&apos;ve <Link href="/talks">talked about that experience a lot</Link>.

                  I bounced between retail and foodservice jobs for a while, still unsure of what I wanted to do. There was a software apprenticeship program looking for apprentices in Tampa near the city that I lived in. It felt like serendipity. I replied to the job posting and was invited to come into the office. After hearing more about the role, I asked how I could join the program. The application process was to build an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game. Up until this point, I had written mostly HTML/CSS and a little bit of PHP.

                  On the way home, I stopped at a bookstore.

                  <strong>Sharing things on the web isn&apos;t new for me</strong>. I&apos;ve been sharing (and let&apos;s face it, oversharing) online for over 15 years. This blog is a continuation of that impulse, a little more professional, a little more focused, but at its roots is the seed planted by me as a preteen.

                  When I&apos;m not writing code, I&apos;m either at pilates, playing board games with friends, or doing a crossword puzzle. I&apos;m also obsessed with reality television shows like Survivor, Big Brother, and the Bachelor extended universe. I <Link href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3168826-meagan-waller" target="_blank">love to read</Link>, cook, and I want to say I&apos;m a plant lover, but I don&apos;t know if you&apos;re supposed to be continually bringing things to the brink of death if you love them.
